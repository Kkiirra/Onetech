In this project, I acted as a backend developer. Since I didn't have a team, I used an empty WordPress template.

This project is written in Django with Postgres. I also wrote AJAX scripts for asynchronous data output to the site.

The project also paid attention to the architecture of the project. Each application in the project is written separately, 
for more convenient maintenance of the code in the future.

The user's cart was written using Django sessions so that we don't have to store data we don't need on the server, and the recently viewed items 
for users were written using sessions.

Also on the site there is a password reset via mail and authorization.
